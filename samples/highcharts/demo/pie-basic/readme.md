# Pie chart

The pie chart is an excellent chart to visualize a quick overview of a **composition** or a **comparison**.

#### Tip
Users can get confused quickly if a high number of data sets is used.

Notice the use of the feature [sliced](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series%3Cpie%3E.data.sliced) to detach the slice from the center.
