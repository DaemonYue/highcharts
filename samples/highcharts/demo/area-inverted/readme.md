# Inverted axes

Inverted axes chart can be used to highlight the x axis data instead of the y axis, as users tend to read from left to right. 

#### Tip
Notice the use of the feature [inverted](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.inverted) to invert the chart. 

Change the opacity of the area by setting the feature [fillOpacity](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.fillOpacity) under plotOptions.

Keep in mind to change the x axis from left to right, in case of the users read from right to left.
