# Heat map
The heat map is the perfect chart to visualize [hot spots](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/hotspots.html) within a large number of data, and to find pattern or correlation in the data as well. This visualization is possible thanks to the use of the colors and to the compact design that allow to visualize a huge data number and to find patterns.

#### Tip
Use the following data format **Data:[x,y,value]**, where value represents the density of the color to display on the chart.
