# Pie with legend

In this chart the data labels are disabled and the legend enabled. In general, it is recommended to go with the default option and leave the data labels, as it is easier to read a chart where the labels are next to the shapes. But this option provides a cleaner visual appearance.

#### Tip
Notice the use of the feature [dataLabels](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.pie.dataLabels.enabled) to enable or disable the labels.
