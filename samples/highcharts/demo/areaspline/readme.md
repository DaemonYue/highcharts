# Area-spline

Area spline is a variant of area chart with smooth curves. 

#### Tip
Notice the use of the [plotBands](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.plotBands) feature to highlight a specific spot on the chart. 

Change the opacity of the area by setting the feature [fillOpacity](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.fillOpacity) under plotOptions.
