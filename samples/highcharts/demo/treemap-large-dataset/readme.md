# Large tree map

A treemap with the drilling capability is a powerful chart to visualize **comparison** and **hierarchy**. The first level of this demo allows the users to get a quick overview of the global mortality rate comparison in 2012 between the continent, where the drill down focus on the hierarchy aspect of the chart.

#### Tip
Set the feature [allowDrillToNode](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.treemap.allowDrillToNode) to true to enable the drill down capability.
