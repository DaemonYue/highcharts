# Stacked bar
A stacked bar chart is an excellent choice to **compare** data sets, and also to show data that accumulated up to a sum. By stacking series on each other, the users focus more on each bar at the time. 

#### Tip
Notice the use of the [stacking](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.bar.stacking) feature with the value `normal`.
