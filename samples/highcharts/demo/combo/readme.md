# Columns, line, and pie

Combine multiple charts series on one chart is very powerful visualization, as each series type brings its benefits to a better understanding and clarity. In this demo, the pie chart offers a global **comparison** overview, and the column chart visualizes a detailed comparison. The line chart shows the average **trend** over time.

#### Tip
Keep in mind to create simple charts and to avoid using an overwhelming number of charts types.
