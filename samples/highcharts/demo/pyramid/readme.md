# Pyramid chart
The pyramid chart is often used to visualize a **hierarchical** structure that has a progressive order, such as sales progress.

#### Tip
Add the [Highcharts funnel module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/funnel-series) to render the pyramid chart, but set the type to `pyramid` in the chart option.

To center the pyramid and the labels use the [center](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.pyramid.center) feature under plotOptions.
