# Basic bar

A bar chart is often used to visualize **comparisons** between data sets with discrete data, where the focus is on the categories instead of the values as people read from left to right. In this demo, the population of Asia is the largest population in comparison to the rest of the continents.
The code of this demo is very simple to set as many features are already set by default such as the responsiveness, tooltip, colors, legend, etc.

#### Tip
Adapt the x axis to the right if the audience read from right to left, for instance, an audience from the Middle East.
