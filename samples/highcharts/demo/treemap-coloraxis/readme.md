# Tree map with color axis
Treemap is the perfect chart to visualize **hierarchy** and **comparison**, as it gives a quick and high-level view of the data set. Treemap uses mainly a color and value to visualize each element; the value is used to show the size of the element, and the color shows the category or the importance of the element.

#### Tip
Add the [Highcharts treemap module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treemap) to render the heat map, and the [Highcharts heatmap module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/heatmap) to visualize colors.
