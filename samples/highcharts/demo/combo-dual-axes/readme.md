# Dual axes, line, and column

This demo uses two different y axes to represent completely different data set such as the temperature and the rainfall. It combines the benefits of a column series type and the line series type.
The column series type shows the rainfall **comparison** for each month, where the line series type visualizes the **variation** of the temperature over the time.

#### Tip

Notice the use of the [opposite](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.opposite) feature to set the rainfall axis on the right side.
