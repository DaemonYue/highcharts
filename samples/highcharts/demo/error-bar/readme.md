# Error bar
The error bar is mainly used to visualize the error or uncertainty in a measurement system.

#### Tip
Notice the use of the [opposite](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.opposite) feature to set the rainfall axis on the right side.

Set the chart type to `errorbar` to enable the Error bar chart.
